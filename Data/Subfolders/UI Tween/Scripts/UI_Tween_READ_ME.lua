	Hello :)

	-----------------------------------------------------------

	UI Tween is a tweening library that is suitable for beginners who are comfortable with basic Lua. The library
	comes with a custom tweening engine, and includes the standard easing equations from Robert Penner. As well
	as those easing equations, support for curves is also including if you need something more custom.

	The API is very straight forward, and the documentation on the web explains all the functions and how to use them.

	It supports a lot of the 2D UI components, so you can tween stuff like opacity, alpha, color, size, position, rotation,
	scrollPosition, progress bars, buttons and more.  It does all the heavy lifting for you, and it's easy to chain
	animations to do more complex stuff.

	Also comes with an event system so you can react to tweens when they start, change, or complete.

	UI Tween Examples
	-----------------

	I have included 3 templates that you can drag and drop into yur hierarchy so you can test out some of the animations.
	These only scratch the surface at what you can do with a tweening library.

	In the future I will be releasing a more advanced tweening library aimed at more experienced programmers that also
	supports 3D.

	The basic example comes with 12 you can try.  It's best to try them in order because some animations rely on the state
	of the previous animation being completed.

	The second example uses the UI Kit from Lakwaai to show you how easy it is to use existing UI Kits from Community Content, 
	and add some animations to them with a few lines of code.
